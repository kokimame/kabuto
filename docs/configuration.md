# Configure the bot

Freqtrade has many configurable features and possibilities.
By default, these settings are configured via the configuration file (see below).

## The Freqtrade configuration file

The bot uses a set of configuration parameters during its operation that all together conform the bot configuration. It normally reads its configuration from a file (Freqtrade configuration file).

Per default, the bot loads the configuration from the `config.json` file, located in the current working directory.

You can specify a different configuration file used by the bot with the `-c/--config` command line option.

In some advanced use cases, multiple configuration files can be specified and used by the bot or the bot can read its configuration parameters from the process standard input stream.

If you used the [Quick start](installation.md/#quick-start) method for installing 
the bot, the installation script should have already created the default configuration file (`config.json`) for you.

If default configuration file is not created we recommend you to copy and use the `config.json.example` as a template
for your bot configuration.

The Freqtrade configuration file is to be written in the JSON format.

Additionally to the standard JSON syntax, you may use one-line `// ...` and multi-line `/* ... */` comments in your configuration files and trailing commas in the lists of parameters.

Do not worry if you are not familiar with JSON format -- simply open the configuration file with an editor of your choice, make some changes to the parameters you need, save your changes and, finally, restart the bot or, if it was previously stopped, run it again with the changes you made to the configuration. The bot validates syntax of the configuration file at startup and will warn you if you made any errors editing it, pointing out problematic lines.

## Configuration parameters

The table below will list all configuration parameters available.

Freqtrade can also load many options via command line (CLI) arguments (check out the commands `--help` output for details).
The prevelance for all Options is as follows:

- CLI arguments override any other option
- Configuration files are used in sequence (last file wins), and override Strategy configurations.
- Strategy configurations are only used if they are not set via configuration or via command line arguments. These options are market with [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-the-strategy) in the below table.

Mandatory parameters are marked as **Required**, which means that they are required to be set in one of the possible ways.

|  Command | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_open_trades` | 3 | **Required.** Number of trades open your bot will have. If -1 then it is ignored (i.e. potentially unlimited open trades)
| `stake_currency` | BTC | **Required.** Crypto-currency used for trading.
| `stake_amount` | 0.05 | **Required.** Amount of crypto-currency your bot will use for each trade. Per default, the bot will use (0.05 BTC x 3) = 0.15 BTC in total will be always engaged. Set it to `"unlimited"` to allow the bot to use all available balance.
| `amount_reserve_percent` | 0.05 | Reserve some amount in min pair stake amount. Default is 5%. The bot will reserve `amount_reserve_percent` + stop-loss value when calculating min pair stake amount in order to avoid possible trade refusals.
| `ticker_interval` | [1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 1d, ...] | The ticker interval to use (1min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour or 1 day). Default is 5 minutes. [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-the-strategy).

| `process_only_new_candles` | false | If set to true indicators are processed only once a new candle arrives. If false each loop populates the indicators, this will mean the same candle is processed many times creating system load but can be useful of your strategy depends on tick data not only candle. [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-the-strategy).
| `minimal_roi` | See below | Set the threshold in percent the bot will use to sell a trade. More information below. [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-the-strategy).

| `bid_strategy.use_order_book` | false | Allows buying of pair using the rates in Order Book Bids.
| `bid_strategy.order_book_top` | 0 | Bot will use the top N rate in Order Book Bids. I.e. a value of 2 will allow the bot to pick the 2nd bid rate in Order Book Bids.
| `bid_strategy. check_depth_of_market.enabled` | false | Does not buy if the % difference of buy orders and sell orders is met in Order Book.
| `bid_strategy. check_depth_of_market.bids_to_ask_delta` | 0 | The % difference of buy orders and sell orders found in Order Book. A value lesser than 1 means sell orders is greater, while value greater than 1 means buy orders is higher.
| `ask_strategy.use_order_book` | false | Allows selling of open traded pair using the rates in Order Book Asks.

### Parameters in the strategy

The following parameters can be set in either configuration file or strategy.
Values set in the configuration file always overwrite values set in the strategy.

* `ticker_interval`
* `minimal_roi`
* `stoploss`
* `trailing_stop`
* `trailing_stop_positive`
* `trailing_stop_positive_offset`
* `process_only_new_candles`
* `order_types`
* `order_time_in_force`
* `use_sell_signal` (ask_strategy)
* `sell_profit_only` (ask_strategy)
* `ignore_roi_if_buy_signal` (ask_strategy)

### Understand stake_amount

The `stake_amount` configuration parameter is an amount of crypto-currency your bot will use for each trade.
The minimal value is 0.0005. If there is not enough crypto-currency in
the account an exception is generated.
To allow the bot to trade all the available `stake_currency` in your account set

```json
"stake_amount" : "unlimited",
```

In this case a trade amount is calclulated as:

```python
currency_balanse / (max_open_trades - current_open_trades)
```

### Understand minimal_roi

The `minimal_roi` configuration parameter is a JSON object where the key is a duration
in minutes and the value is the minimum ROI in percent.
See the example below:

```json
"minimal_roi": {
    "40": 0.0,    # Sell after 40 minutes if the profit is not negative
    "30": 0.01,   # Sell after 30 minutes if there is at least 1% profit
    "20": 0.02,   # Sell after 20 minutes if there is at least 2% profit
    "0":  0.04    # Sell immediately if there is at least 4% profit
},
```

Most of the strategy files already include the optimal `minimal_roi` value.
This parameter can be set in either Strategy or Configuration file. If you use it in the configuration file, it will override the
`minimal_roi` value from the strategy file.
If it is not set in either Strategy or Configuration, a default of 1000% `{"0": 10}` is used, and minimal roi is disabled unless your trade generates 1000% profit.

### Understand stoploss

Go to the [stoploss documentation](stoploss.md) for more details.

### Understand trailing stoploss

Go to the [trailing stoploss Documentation](stoploss.md#trailing-stop-loss) for details on trailing stoploss.

### Understand initial_state

The `initial_state` configuration parameter is an optional field that defines the initial application state.
Possible values are `running` or `stopped`. (default=`running`)
If the value is `stopped` the bot has to be started with `/start` first.

### Understand forcebuy_enable

The `forcebuy_enable` configuration parameter enables the usage of forcebuy commands via Telegram.
This is disabled for security reasons by default, and will show a warning message on startup if enabled.
For example, you can send `/forcebuy ETH/BTC` Telegram command when this feature if enabled to the bot,
who then buys the pair and holds it until a regular sell-signal (ROI, stoploss, /forcesell) appears.

This can be dangerous with some strategies, so use with care.

See [the telegram documentation](telegram-usage.md) for details on usage.

### Understand process_throttle_secs

The `process_throttle_secs` configuration parameter is an optional field that defines in seconds how long the bot should wait
before asking the strategy if we should buy or a sell an asset. After each wait period, the strategy is asked again for
every opened trade wether or not we should sell, and for all the remaining pairs (either the dynamic list of pairs or
the static list of pairs) if we should buy.

### Understand ask_last_balance

The `ask_last_balance` configuration parameter sets the bidding price. Value `0.0` will use `ask` price, `1.0` will
use the `last` price and values between those interpolate between ask and last
price. Using `ask` price will guarantee quick success in bid, but bot will also
end up paying more then would probably have been necessary.

### Understand order_types

The `order_types` configuration parameter maps actions (`buy`, `sell`, `stoploss`) to order-types (`market`, `limit`, ...) as well as configures stoploss to be on the exchange and defines stoploss on exchange update interval in seconds.

This allows to buy using limit orders, sell using
limit-orders, and create stoplosses using using market orders. It also allows to set the
stoploss "on exchange" which means stoploss order would be placed immediately once
the buy order is fulfilled.
If `stoploss_on_exchange` and `trailing_stop` are both set, then the bot will use `stoploss_on_exchange_interval` to check and update the stoploss on exchange periodically.
`order_types` can be set in the configuration file or in the strategy.
`order_types` set in the configuration file overwrites values set in the strategy as a whole, so you need to configure the whole `order_types` dictionary in one place.

If this is configured, the following 4 values (`buy`, `sell`, `stoploss` and
`stoploss_on_exchange`) need to be present, otherwise the bot will fail to start.

`emergencysell` is an optional value, which defaults to `market` and is used when creating stoploss on exchange orders fails.
The below is the default which is used if this is not configured in either strategy or configuration file.

Syntax for Strategy:

```python
order_types = {
    "buy": "limit",
    "sell": "limit",
    "emergencysell": "market",
    "stoploss": "market",
    "stoploss_on_exchange": False,
    "stoploss_on_exchange_interval": 60
}
```

Configuration:

```json
"order_types": {
    "buy": "limit",
    "sell": "limit",
    "emergencysell": "market",
    "stoploss": "market",
    "stoploss_on_exchange": false,
    "stoploss_on_exchange_interval": 60
}
```

!!! Note
    Not all exchanges support "market" orders.
    The following message will be shown if your exchange does not support market orders:
    `"Exchange <yourexchange>  does not support market orders."`

!!! Note
    Stoploss on exchange interval is not mandatory. Do not change its value if you are
    unsure of what you are doing. For more information about how stoploss works please
    refer to [the stoploss documentation](stoploss.md).

!!! Note
    If `stoploss_on_exchange` is enabled and the stoploss is cancelled manually on the exchange, then the bot will create a new order.

!!! Warning stoploss_on_exchange failures
    If stoploss on exchange creation fails for some reason, then an "emergency sell" is initiated. By default, this will sell the asset using a market order. The order-type for the emergency-sell can be changed by setting the `emergencysell` value in the `order_types` dictionary - however this is not advised.

### Understand order_time_in_force

The `order_time_in_force` configuration parameter defines the policy by which the order
is executed on the exchange. Three commonly used time in force are:

**GTC (Good Till Canceled):**

This is most of the time the default time in force. It means the order will remain
on exchange till it is canceled by user. It can be fully or partially fulfilled.
If partially fulfilled, the remaining will stay on the exchange till cancelled.

**FOK (Full Or Kill):**

It means if the order is not executed immediately AND fully then it is canceled by the exchange.

**IOC (Immediate Or Canceled):**

It is the same as FOK (above) except it can be partially fulfilled. The remaining part
is automatically cancelled by the exchange.

The `order_time_in_force` parameter contains a dict with buy and sell time in force policy values.
This can be set in the configuration file or in the strategy.
Values set in the configuration file overwrites values set in the strategy.

The possible values are: `gtc` (default), `fok` or `ioc`.

``` python
"order_time_in_force": {
    "buy": "gtc",
    "sell": "gtc"
},
```

!!! Warning
    This is an ongoing work. For now it is supported only for binance and only for buy orders.
    Please don't change the default value unless you know what you are doing.

### Exchange configuration

Freqtrade is based on [CCXT library](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) that supports over 100 cryptocurrency
exchange markets and trading APIs. The complete up-to-date list can be found in the
[CCXT repo homepage](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/tree/master/python). However, the bot was tested
with only Bittrex and Binance.

The bot was tested with the following exchanges:

- [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/): "bittrex"
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/): "binance"

Feel free to test other exchanges and submit your PR to improve the bot.

#### Sample exchange configuration

A exchange configuration for "binance" would look as follows:

```json
"exchange": {
    "name": "binance",
    "key": "your_exchange_key",
    "secret": "your_exchange_secret",
    "ccxt_config": {"enableRateLimit": true},
    "ccxt_async_config": {
        "enableRateLimit": true,
        "rateLimit": 200
    },
```

This configuration enables binance, as well as rate limiting to avoid bans from the exchange.
`"rateLimit": 200` defines a wait-event of 0.2s between each call. This can also be completely disabled by setting `"enableRateLimit"` to false.

!!! Note
    Optimal settings for rate limiting depend on the exchange and the size of the whitelist, so an ideal parameter will vary on many other settings.
    We try to provide sensible defaults per exchange where possible, if you encounter bans please make sure that `"enableRateLimit"` is enabled and increase the `"rateLimit"` parameter step by step.

#### Advanced FreqTrade Exchange configuration

Advanced options can be configured using the `_ft_has_params` setting, which will override Defaults and exchange-specific behaviours.

Available options are listed in the exchange-class as `_ft_has_default`.

For example, to test the order type `FOK` with Kraken, and modify candle_limit to 200 (so you only get 200 candles per call):

```json
"exchange": {
    "name": "kraken",
    "_ft_has_params": {
        "order_time_in_force": ["gtc", "fok"],
        "ohlcv_candle_limit": 200
        }
```

!!! Warning
    Please make sure to fully understand the impacts of these settings before modifying them.

### What values can be used for fiat_display_currency?

The `fiat_display_currency` configuration parameter sets the base currency to use for the
conversion from coin to fiat in the bot Telegram reports.

The valid values are:

```json
"AUD", "BRL", "CAD", "CHF", "CLP", "CNY", "CZK", "DKK", "EUR", "GBP", "HKD", "HUF", "IDR", "ILS", "INR", "JPY", "KRW", "MXN", "MYR", "NOK", "NZD", "PHP", "PKR", "PLN", "RUB", "SEK", "SGD", "THB", "TRY", "TWD", "ZAR", "USD"
```

In addition to fiat currencies, a range of cryto currencies are supported.

The valid values are:

```json
"BTC", "ETH", "XRP", "LTC", "BCH", "USDT"
```

## Switch to Dry-run mode

We recommend starting the bot in the Dry-run mode to see how your bot will
behave and what is the performance of your strategy. In the Dry-run mode the
bot does not engage your money. It only runs a live simulation without
creating trades on the exchange.

1. Edit your `config.json` configuration file.
2. Switch `dry-run` to `true` and specify `db_url` for a persistence database.

```json
"dry_run": true,
"db_url": "sqlite:///tradesv3.dryrun.sqlite",
```

3. Remove your Exchange API key and secrete (change them by empty values or fake credentials):

```json
"exchange": {
        "name": "bittrex",
        "key": "key",
        "secret": "secret",
        ...
}
```

Once you will be happy with your bot performance running in the Dry-run mode,
you can switch it to production mode.

### Dynamic Pairlists

Dynamic pairlists select pairs for you based on the logic configured.
The bot runs against all pairs (with that stake) on the exchange, and a number of assets
(`number_assets`) is selected based on the selected criteria.

By default, the `StaticPairList` method is used.
The Pairlist method is configured as `pair_whitelist` parameter under the `exchange`
section of the configuration.

**Available Pairlist methods:**

* `StaticPairList`
  * It uses configuration from `exchange.pair_whitelist` and `exchange.pair_blacklist`.
* `VolumePairList`
  * It selects `number_assets` top pairs based on `sort_key`, which can be one of
`askVolume`, `bidVolume` and `quoteVolume`, defaults to `quoteVolume`.
  * There is a possibility to filter low-value coins that would not allow setting a stop loss
(set `precision_filter` parameter to `true` for this).

Example:

```json
"pairlist": {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "config": {
            "number_assets": 20,
            "sort_key": "quoteVolume",
            "precision_filter": false
        }
    },
```

## Switch to production mode

In production mode, the bot will engage your money. Be careful, since a wrong
strategy can lose all your money. Be aware of what you are doing when
you run it in production mode.

### To switch your bot in production mode

**Edit your `config.json`  file.**

**Switch dry-run to false and don't forget to adapt your database URL if set:**

```json
"dry_run": false,
```

**Insert your Exchange API key (change them by fake api keys):**

```json
"exchange": {
        "name": "bittrex",
        "key": "af8ddd35195e9dc500b9a6f799f6f5c93d89193b",
        "secret": "08a9dc6db3d7b53e1acebd9275677f4b0a04f1a5",
        ...
}

```
!!! Note
    If you have an exchange API key yet, [see our tutorial](/pre-requisite).

### Using proxy with FreqTrade

To use a proxy with freqtrade, add the kwarg `"aiohttp_trust_env"=true` to the `"ccxt_async_kwargs"` dict in the exchange section of the configuration.

An example for this can be found in `config_full.json.example`

``` json
"ccxt_async_config": {
    "aiohttp_trust_env": true
}
```

Then, export your proxy settings using the variables `"HTTP_PROXY"` and `"HTTPS_PROXY"` set to the appropriate values

``` bash
export HTTP_PROXY="http://addr:port"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://addr:port"
freqtrade
```


### Embedding Strategies

FreqTrade provides you with with an easy way to embed the strategy into your configuration file.
This is done by utilizing BASE64 encoding and providing this string at the strategy configuration field,
in your chosen config file.

#### Encoding a string as BASE64

This is a quick example, how to generate the BASE64 string in python

```python
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

with open(file, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
content = urlsafe_b64encode(content.encode('utf-8'))
```

The variable 'content', will contain the strategy file in a BASE64 encoded form. Which can now be set in your configurations file as following

```json
"strategy": "NameOfStrategy:BASE64String"
```

Please ensure that 'NameOfStrategy' is identical to the strategy name!

## Next step

Now you have configured your config.json, the next step is to [start your bot](bot-usage.md).
