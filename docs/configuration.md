# Configure the bot

This page explains how to configure your `config.json` file.

## Setup config.json

We recommend to copy and use the `config.json.example` as a template
for your bot configuration.

The table below will list all configuration parameters.

Mandatory Parameters are marked as **Required**.

|  Command | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_open_trades` | 3 | **Required.** Number of trades open your bot will have. If -1 then it is ignored (i.e. potentially unlimited open trades)
| `stake_currency` | BTC | **Required.** Crypto-currency used for trading.
| `stake_amount` | 0.05 | **Required.** Amount of crypto-currency your bot will use for each trade. Per default, the bot will use (0.05 BTC x 3) = 0.15 BTC in total will be always engaged. Set it to `"unlimited"` to allow the bot to use all available balance.
| `amount_reserve_percent` | 0.05 | Reserve some amount in min pair stake amount. Default is 5%. The bot will reserve `amount_reserve_percent` + stop-loss value when calculating min pair stake amount in order to avoid possible trade refusals.
| `ticker_interval` | [1m, 5m, 30m, 1h, 1d] | The ticker interval to use (1min, 5 min, 30 min, 1 hour or 1 day). Default is 5 minutes. [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-strategy).

| `process_only_new_candles` | false | If set to true indicators are processed only once a new candle arrives. If false each loop populates the indicators, this will mean the same candle is processed many times creating system load but can be useful of your strategy depends on tick data not only candle. [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-strategy).
| `minimal_roi` | See below | Set the threshold in percent the bot will use to sell a trade. More information below. [Strategy Override](#parameters-in-strategy).

### Parameters in strategy

The following parameters can be set in either configuration or strategy.
Values in the configuration are always overwriting values set in the strategy.

* `minimal_roi`
* `ticker_interval`
* `stoploss`
* `trailing_stop`
* `trailing_stop_positive`
* `trailing_stop_positive_offset`
* `process_only_new_candles`
* `order_types`
* `order_time_in_force`
* `use_sell_signal` (experimental)
* `sell_profit_only` (experimental)
* `ignore_roi_if_buy_signal` (experimental)

### Understand stake_amount

`stake_amount` is an amount of crypto-currency your bot will use for each trade.
The minimal value is 0.0005. If there is not enough crypto-currency in
the account an exception is generated.
To allow the bot to trade all the available `stake_currency` in your account set

```json
"stake_amount" : "unlimited",
```

In this case a trade amount is calclulated as: 

```python
currency_balanse / (max_open_trades - current_open_trades)
```

### Understand minimal_roi

`minimal_roi` is a JSON object where the key is a duration
in minutes and the value is the minimum ROI in percent.
See the example below:

```json
"minimal_roi": {
    "40": 0.0,    # Sell after 40 minutes if the profit is not negative
    "30": 0.01,   # Sell after 30 minutes if there is at least 1% profit
    "20": 0.02,   # Sell after 20 minutes if there is at least 2% profit
    "0":  0.04    # Sell immediately if there is at least 4% profit
},
```

Most of the strategy files already include the optimal `minimal_roi`
value. This parameter is optional. If you use it, it will take over the
`minimal_roi` value from the strategy file.

### Understand stoploss

`stoploss` is loss in percentage that should trigger a sale.
For example value `-0.10` will cause immediate sell if the
profit dips below -10% for a given trade. This parameter is optional.

Most of the strategy files already include the optimal `stoploss`
value. This parameter is optional. If you use it, it will take over the
`stoploss` value from the strategy file.

### Understand trailing stoploss

Go to the [trailing stoploss Documentation](stoploss.md) for details on trailing stoploss.

### Understand initial_state

`initial_state` is an optional field that defines the initial application state.
Possible values are `running` or `stopped`. (default=`running`)
If the value is `stopped` the bot has to be started with `/start` first.

### Understand forcebuy_enable

`forcebuy_enable` enables the usage of forcebuy commands via Telegram.
This is disabled for security reasons by default, and will show a warning message on startup if enabled.
You send `/forcebuy ETH/BTC` to the bot, who buys the pair and holds it until a regular sell-signal appears (ROI, stoploss, /forcesell).

Can be dangerous with some strategies, so use with care
See [the telegram documentation](telegram-usage.md) for details on usage.

### Understand process_throttle_secs

`process_throttle_secs` is an optional field that defines in seconds how long the bot should wait
before asking the strategy if we should buy or a sell an asset. After each wait period, the strategy is asked again for
every opened trade wether or not we should sell, and for all the remaining pairs (either the dynamic list of pairs or
the static list of pairs) if we should buy.

### Understand ask_last_balance

`ask_last_balance` sets the bidding price. Value `0.0` will use `ask` price, `1.0` will
use the `last` price and values between those interpolate between ask and last
price. Using `ask` price will guarantee quick success in bid, but bot will also
end up paying more then would probably have been necessary.

### Understand order_types

`order_types` contains a dict mapping order-types to market-types as well as stoploss on or off exchange type and stoploss on exchange update interval in seconds. This allows to buy using limit orders, sell using limit-orders, and create stoploss orders using market. It also allows to set the stoploss "on exchange" which means stoploss order would be placed immediately once the buy order is fulfilled. In case stoploss on exchange and `trailing_stop` are both set, then the bot will use `stoploss_on_exchange_interval` to check it periodically and update it if necessary (e.x. in case of trailing stoploss).
This can be set in the configuration or in the strategy. Configuration overwrites strategy configurations.

If this is configured, all 4 values (`"buy"`, `"sell"`, `"stoploss"` and `"stoploss_on_exchange"`) need to be present, otherwise the bot warn about it and will fail to start.
The below is the default which is used if this is not configured in either Strategy or configuration.

```python
"order_types": {
    "buy": "limit",
    "sell": "limit",
    "stoploss": "market",
    "stoploss_on_exchange": False,
    "stoploss_on_exchange_interval": 60
},
```

!!! Note
    Not all exchanges support "market" orders.
    The following message will be shown if your exchange does not support market orders: `"Exchange <yourexchange>  does not support market orders."`

!!! Note
    stoploss on exchange interval is not mandatory. Do not change it's value if you are unsure of what you are doing. For more information about how stoploss works please read [the stoploss documentation](stoploss.md).

### Understand order_time_in_force
`order_time_in_force` defines the policy by which the order is executed on the exchange. Three commonly used time in force are:<br/>
**GTC (Goog Till Canceled):**
This is most of the time the default time in force. It means the order will remain on exchange till it is canceled by user. It can be fully or partially fulfilled. If partially fulfilled, the remaining will stay on the exchange till cancelled.<br/>
**FOK (Full Or Kill):**
It means if the order is not executed immediately AND fully then it is canceled by the exchange.<br/>
**IOC (Immediate Or Canceled):**
It is the same as FOK (above) except it can be partially fulfilled. The remaining part is automatically cancelled by the exchange.
<br/>
`order_time_in_force` contains a dict buy and sell time in force policy. This can be set in the configuration or in the strategy. Configuration overwrites strategy configurations.<br/>
possible values are: `gtc` (default), `fok` or `ioc`.<br/>
``` python
"order_time_in_force": {
    "buy": "gtc",
    "sell": "gtc"
},
```

!!! Warning
    This is an ongoing work. For now it is supported only for binance and only for buy orders. Please don't change the default value unless you know what you are doing.

### What values for exchange.name?

Freqtrade is based on [CCXT library](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) that supports 115 cryptocurrency
exchange markets and trading APIs. The complete up-to-date list can be found in the
[CCXT repo homepage](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/tree/master/python). However, the bot was tested
with only Bittrex and Binance.

The bot was tested with the following exchanges:

- [Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/): "bittrex"
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/): "binance"

Feel free to test other exchanges and submit your PR to improve the bot.

### What values for fiat_display_currency?

`fiat_display_currency` set the base currency to use for the conversion from coin to fiat in Telegram.
The valid values are:<br/>
```json
"AUD", "BRL", "CAD", "CHF", "CLP", "CNY", "CZK", "DKK", "EUR", "GBP", "HKD", "HUF", "IDR", "ILS", "INR", "JPY", "KRW", "MXN", "MYR", "NOK", "NZD", "PHP", "PKR", "PLN", "RUB", "SEK", "SGD", "THB", "TRY", "TWD", "ZAR", "USD"
```
In addition to FIAT currencies, a range of cryto currencies are supported.
The valid values are:
```json
"BTC", "ETH", "XRP", "LTC", "BCH", "USDT"
```

## Switch to dry-run mode

We recommend starting the bot in dry-run mode to see how your bot will
behave and how is the performance of your strategy. In Dry-run mode the
bot does not engage your money. It only runs a live simulation without
creating trades.

1. Edit your `config.json`  file
2. Switch dry-run to true and specify db_url for a persistent db

```json
"dry_run": true,
"db_url": "sqlite:///tradesv3.dryrun.sqlite",
```

3. Remove your Exchange API key (change them by fake api credentials)

```json
"exchange": {
        "name": "bittrex",
        "key": "key",
        "secret": "secret",
        ...
}
```

Once you will be happy with your bot performance, you can switch it to
production mode.

### Dynamic Pairlists

Dynamic pairlists select pairs for you based on the logic configured.
The bot runs against all pairs (with that stake) on the exchange, and a number of assets (`number_assets`) is selected based on the selected criteria.

By default, a Static Pairlist is used (configured as `"pair_whitelist"` under the `"exchange"` section of this configuration).

**Available Pairlist methods:**

* `"StaticPairList"`
  * uses configuration from `exchange.pair_whitelist` and `exchange.pair_blacklist`
* `"VolumePairList"`
  * Formerly available as `--dynamic-whitelist [<number_assets>]`
  * Selects `number_assets` top pairs based on `sort_key`, which can be one of `askVolume`, `bidVolume` and `quoteVolume`, defaults to `quoteVolume`.

```json
"pairlist": {
        "method": "VolumePairList",
        "config": {
            "number_assets": 20,
            "sort_key": "quoteVolume"
        }
    },
```

## Switch to production mode

In production mode, the bot will engage your money. Be careful a wrong
strategy can lose all your money. Be aware of what you are doing when
you run it in production mode.

### To switch your bot in production mode

**Edit your `config.json`  file.**

**Switch dry-run to false and don't forget to adapt your database URL if set:**

```json
"dry_run": false,
```

**Insert your Exchange API key (change them by fake api keys):**

```json
"exchange": {
        "name": "bittrex",
        "key": "af8ddd35195e9dc500b9a6f799f6f5c93d89193b",
        "secret": "08a9dc6db3d7b53e1acebd9275677f4b0a04f1a5",
        ...
}

```
!!! Note
    If you have an exchange API key yet, [see our tutorial](/pre-requisite).

### Using proxy with FreqTrade

To use a proxy with freqtrade, add the kwarg `"aiohttp_trust_env"=true` to the `"ccxt_async_kwargs"` dict in the exchange section of the configuration.

An example for this can be found in `config_full.json.example`

``` json
"ccxt_async_config": {
    "aiohttp_trust_env": true
}
```

Then, export your proxy settings using the variables `"HTTP_PROXY"` and `"HTTPS_PROXY"` set to the appropriate values

``` bash
export HTTP_PROXY="http://addr:port"
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://addr:port"
freqtrade
```


### Embedding Strategies

FreqTrade provides you with with an easy way to embed the strategy into your configuration file.
This is done by utilizing BASE64 encoding and providing this string at the strategy configuration field,
in your chosen config file.

#### Encoding a string as BASE64

This is a quick example, how to generate the BASE64 string in python

```python
from base64 import urlsafe_b64encode

with open(file, 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
content = urlsafe_b64encode(content.encode('utf-8'))
```

The variable 'content', will contain the strategy file in a BASE64 encoded form. Which can now be set in your configurations file as following

```json
"strategy": "NameOfStrategy:BASE64String"
```

Please ensure that 'NameOfStrategy' is identical to the strategy name!

## Next step

Now you have configured your config.json, the next step is to [start your bot](bot-usage.md).
